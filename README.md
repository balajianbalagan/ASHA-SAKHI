## üí° Project Motivation

Our team was inspired by the challenges faced by ASHA workers in rural India. Having experienced the critical nature of timely medical assistance firsthand, we understand the importance of reliable healthcare support. ASHA workers, despite being crucial to community health, often face technical barriers like poor connectivity and limited resources.

This project aims to bridge these gaps by:
- Providing instant AI assistance without internet dependency
- Supporting multiple local languages
- Working on basic Android devices
- Integrating with existing healthcare workflows
